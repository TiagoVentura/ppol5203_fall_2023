# Welcome to Data Science I {background-color="#447099"}

## Plans for Today

<br>

-   What is [Data Science for Public Policy]{.blue} \| [Computational Social Science]{.blue} ?

-   Goals of the course

-   Course Logistics

-   IDEs

    -   Jupyter
    -   Quarto

-   Introduction to Commandline

-   Q&A

# Why are we here? {background-color="#447099"}

## Data is everywhere!

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("week1_figs/data_store.png") 
```

## Real Time Data: Mobility, Credit Card Usage, Expenses...

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("week1_figs/mob_01.png") 
```

## Social Media Data

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("week1_figs/redes.png") 
```

## New Data Formats: Image, text, videos..

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("week1_figs/tweets.png") 
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("week1_figs/imagescnn.png") 
```

## Online Research

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("week1_figs/survey.png") 
```

## Powerful Computers

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("week1_figs/collab.png") 
```

## As a consequence:

-   Abundance of data we can use for research and governments can use to make better decisions

    -   Novel research questions

    -   New ways to answer old, long-standing research questions

-   New technologies also have social implications and can generate important policy questions.

    -   Privacy issues

    -   Use of technology by bad actors.

    -   Use of technology by governments to censor/monitor citizens.

    -   etc...

## An example: Merging Voter Files with Twitter Data

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("week1_figs/l2.png") 
```

## What it looks like...

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("week1_figs/resl2.png") 
```

## All the steps + Tools `....` so far `...`

<br>

::: incremental
-   [Step 1]{.blue}: Processing 180M voter files \~ 5terabytes

    -   HPC + Python + Spark

-   [Step 2]{.blue}: Find Matches between voters and Twitter users and Neighboors

    -   HPC + Python

-   [Step 3]{.blue}: Estimate/Impute Ideology for voters and Neighboors

    -   Juggles across multiple dataset (census, precincts, twitter networks) + Python and R

-   [Step 4]{.blue}: Run the analysis

    -   R

## Data Science for Public Policy

<br>

A [Data Scientists for Public Policy]{.red} focuses on **computational approaches** to solve/understand **Policy Problems**.

Take this as a variation of a [computational social scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_social_science) with a more policy-focus.

-   **What is social science?** It refers to a domain of study: social phenomena:

    -   Encompasses many **scales**: human psychology, language, economic behavior, political systems, policy problems
    -   Involve many **approaches**: qualitative interviews, statistical analysis, simulations

-   **What is Data Science?**:

    -   Use often large-scale data + algorithms to answer questions

## Reading

<br>

**Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age** By Mathew Salganik

-   [Introduction](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/introduction/)

-   [Observing Behavior](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/observing-behavior/)

## Goals of the course

<br>

The goal of this course is to teach you:

-   **Computational thinking**: how to approach problems and devise solutions from a computational perspective.

-   Get you started on **Python** and a bit of **SQL** for applied data science; lay the foundations for the remainder of the core sequence

-   **Workflows and tools:** Git/Github + Commandline.

## Final Project

[You will work on **randomly assigned groups!**]{.red}

The project is composed of three parts:

-   a 2 page project proposal: (which should be discussed and approved by me)
-   an in-class presentation,
-   A 10-page project report.

Due dates and breakdowns for the project are as follows:

| **Requirement**  | **Due**      | **Length** | **Percentage** |
|------------------|--------------|------------|----------------|
| Project Proposal | November xxx | 2 pages    | 5%             |
| Presentation     | December xxx | 7 minutes  | 10%            |
| Project Report   | December xx  | 10 pages   | 25%            |

## ChatGPT

You are allowed to use ChatGPT as you would use google.

This means:

-   Do not copy the responses from chatgpt -- a lot of them are wrong or will just not run on your computer

-   Use chatgpt as a auxiliary source.

-   If your entire homework  comes straight from chatgpt, I will consider it plagiarism.

If you use chatgpt, I ask you to mention on your code how chatgpt worked for you. 

[Be mature and make smart decisions. You will not be able to cheat on a coding interview, remember you are a master student now!]{.red}
