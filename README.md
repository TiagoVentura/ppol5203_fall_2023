# PPOL 5203 - Data Science Foundations

Repository for Georgetown McCourt's School of Public Policy's Data Science I (PPOL 5203) in Fall of 2023

## Course Description

This first course in the core data science sequence teaches Data Science for Public Policy (DSPP) students how to synthesize disparate, possibly unstructured data in order to draw meaningful insights. Topics covered include the fundamentals of object-oriented programming in Python; literate programming; an introduction to algorithms and data types; data wrangling, visualization, and extraction; an introduction to machine learning methods, and text analysis. In addition, students will be exposed to Git and Github for version control and reproducible research. The objective of the course is to teach students how incorporate data into their decision-making and analysis. No prior programming experience is assumed or required.

This is not the first time this course is taught at DSPP. For this reason, several of the materials here are borrowed from previous iterations of this PPOL 564 taught by Dr. Rebecca Johnson and Dr. Eric Dunford.
