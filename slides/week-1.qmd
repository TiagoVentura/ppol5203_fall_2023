# Welcome to Data Science I {background-color="#447099"}

## Plans for Today

<br>

-   [Data Science for Public Policy]{.blue}, [Computational Social Science]{.blue}, or why are we here?!

-   Goals of the course

-   Course Logistics

-   Introductions

-   IDEs

    -   Jupyter
    -   Quarto

-   Introduction to Commandline

# Why are we here? {background-color="#447099"}

## Rise of the digital information age

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("week1_figs/digital.jpeg") 
```

::: aside

:::

## Real Time Data: Mobility, Credit Card Usage, Expenses...

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("week1_figs/mob_01.png") 
```

## Social Media Data

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("week1_figs/redes.png") 
```

## New Data Formats: Image, text, videos..

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("week1_figs/tweets.png") 
```

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%",fig.align="center"}

## Online Research

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("week1_figs/survey.png") 
```

## Powerful and Cheap Computer Power

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("week1_figs/collab.png") 
```

## As a consequence:

-   Abundance of data we can use for research and governments can use to make better decisions

    -   Novel research questions

    -   New ways to answer old, long-standing research questions

-   New technologies also have social implications and can generate important policy questions.

    -   Privacy issues

    -   Use of technology by bad actors.

    -   Use of technology by governments to censor/monitor citizens.

    -   etc...

-   Policy scholars need to be equipped for these challenges

## An example: Merging Voter Files with Twitter Data

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("week1_figs/l2.png") 
```

## What it looks like...

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("week1_figs/resl2.png") 
```

## All the steps + Tools `....` so far `...`

<br>

-   [Step 1]{.blue}: Processing 180M voter files \~ 5 terabytes

    -   HPC + Python + Spark

-   [Step 2]{.blue}: Find Matches between voters and Twitter users and Neighboors

    -   HPC + Python

-   [Step 3]{.blue}: Estimate/Impute Ideology for voters and neighboors

    -   Juggles across multiple dataset (census, precincts, twitter networks) + Python and R

-   [Step 4]{.blue}: Run the analysis

    -   R

# Discussion: New Questions vs Social Implications vs Ethical Challenges

## Data Science for Public Policy

[Data Scientist for Public Policy]{.red} focuses on **computational approaches** to solve/understand **Policy Problems**.

-   A part of a larger field on [computational social scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_social_science) with a more policy-focus.

-   **What is social science?** It refers to a domain of study - social phenomena:

    -   Encompasses many **scales**: human psychology, language, economic behavior, political systems, policy problems
    -   Involve many **approaches**: qualitative interviews, statistical analysis, simulations

-   **What is Data Science?**:

    -   Use often large-scale data + algorithms to answer questions

## Readings

<br>

**Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age** By Mathew Salganik

-   [Introduction](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/introduction/)

-   [Observing Behavior](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/observing-behavior/)

## Goals of the course

<br>

The goal of this course is to teach you:

-   **Computational thinking**: how to approach problems and devise solutions from a computational perspective.

-   Get you started on **Python** and a bit of **SQL** for applied data science; lay the foundations for the remainder of the core sequence

-   **Workflows and tools:** Git/Github + Commandline.

## ChatGPT

You are allowed to use ChatGPT as you would use google in this class. This means:

-   Do not copy the responses from chatgpt -- a lot of them are wrong or will just not run on your computer

-   Use chatgpt as a auxiliary source.

-   If your entire homework comes straight from chatgpt, I will consider it plagiarism.

-   If you use chatgpt, I ask you to mention on your code how chatgpt worked for you.

## A comment from the pre-course survey

> Hi professor Ventura! I noticed that we gonna learn multiple data analysis tool this semester and I am definitely a novice of data science. I am little worried about how can I master all of them without being confused, because some commands might be very similar.

## Your turn!

-   Name

-   (Briefly) what you were up to prior to the DSPP

-   If you could have any data source at your disposal, what would it be?

# Let's take a break!

# `r fontawesome::fa("book-open")` Survey Results

## Summary of the survey

-   75% of you have [some]{.red} experience with Python.

-   42% of you have [some]{.red} with SQL and 42% have none (which is great for the intro purposes of this course!)

-   [NONE]{.red} of you were using primarily Python in your work before!

    -   30% using R and 30% using Stata.

-   A few still do not have Python/Jupyter/Github in your laptops. If you are having issue after today, talk to Sierra.

-   Main Policy Areas:

    -   Social Media/Tech (Thank you, my dear students. Not so much for you Elon!)
    -   International Development (let's talk war, peace and RCTs)
    -   Education (Gonna get some data with Professor Johnson)
