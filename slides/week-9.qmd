## Plans for Today

- Introduction to Machine Learning

  - Applications
  
  - Why do we build models in social science?
  
  - Inference vs Predictive Modelling
  
  - Statistical Learning: 
  
    + Supervised vs Unsupervised
    + Regression vs Classification
    + Bias and Variance Trade-off
    + Training models
    
  - Coding: many many many models
