## Plans for Today

<br>

-   Discuss your final project. 

-   Numpy

-   Intro do Pandas

  - Creating DataFrames
  
  - Loading data on pandas

## Final Project

- **What is it?**: A data science project, applying concepts learned throughout the course.

- Involves collecting data, cleaning and analyzing it, and presenting your findings

- The project is composed of three parts:

  - a 2 page project proposal: (which should be discussed and approved by me)

  - an in-class presentation,

  - A 10-page project report.
  
## Deadlines and Logistics


| **Requirement**  | **Due**     | **Length**    | **Percentage** |
|------------------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| Project Proposal | October 31  | 2 pages       | 5%             |
| Presentation     | December 5  | 10-15 minutes | 10%            |
| Project Report   | December 12 | 10 pages      | 25%            |

- Groups of three students. You pick your groups. 

- Before October 24, you should have meet with me to discuss your proposal. 

- At lest one hour before our meeting, send me a draft of your proposal. 
  
# Numpy

## Motivating Numpy

So far, all our datatypes are geared towards kind of unidimensional data. We can get over with this using a nested list:

```{python}
# Read in the gapminder data 
import csv
with open("../lecture_notes/week-04/gapminder.csv",mode="rt") as file:
    data = [row for row in csv.reader(file)]


```

## Nested Lists

<br>

```{python}
# let's see the data

print(data)

```

<br>

**This is a weird data structure. Why??**

## Here comes numpy ...

## Why should you learn? Holds Python together!

## Efficiency

-   Numpy leans toward less flexibility and more efficiency.

-   Lists gives you more flexibility and less efficiency.

-   Allows for easy vectorization of functions

-   Broadcasting for working with arrays with different dimensions

## Materials

-   [Notebook for numpy](/lecture_notes/week-04/_week_4_numpy.html)

-   [Documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)

-   [Cheatsheet Numpy](https://images.datacamp.com/image/upload/v1676302459/Marketing/Blog/Numpy_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)
