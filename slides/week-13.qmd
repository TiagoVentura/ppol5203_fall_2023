## Plans for Today

- **Introduction to SQL** 

   - Motivation

   - Ways to use SQL

  - Overview of main functions

- **Discuss your projects**

# Introduction to SQL

## Database

Assume you are starting a company collecting daily a high volume of data, you can:

- Use a File System store data as daily csvs, jsons, etc..

- **OR** build a structured, secured and efficient system to store and access the data

:::fragment
[Database]{.blue} A database is a structured collection of data designed to store, manage, and retrieve information efficiently.

[Database Management System]{.blue} serves as an interface between the database and its users or the application programs (MySQL, SQLite, Hive, BigQuery (Google), Presto (Meta), Redshift
(Amazon) are all different DBMS.)

[Relational Databases]{.blue} are a type of database where data is represented as tables linked based on common keys (to avoid redundancy)
:::

## Relational Databases

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://assets-global.website-files.com/620d42e86cb8ec4d0839e59d/620d42e96cb8ec659e39f462_99bf70d46cc247be878de9d3a88f0c44.png")
```

## Why Databases? 

As Data Scientists, we will often use Databases, instead of building them. For our purposes, two main advantages: 

- Memory efficient (relational component)

- Relies on Hard Drive memory for storage, not RAM!!

- Databases are optimized to reduce the dependency on RAM when querying your data.

- DBMS enforces rules to maintain data integrity and consistency (stop you of adding corrupt data)

## SQL

- SQL (pronounced S-Q-L or SEQUEL) is a language designed to [query relational databases]{.red}

- While relatively uncommon in academia, many companies / governments expect data scientists to be able to write SQL queries

- The result of an SQL query is always a [table]{.red}

- It’s a [nonprocedural language]{.red}: define inputs and outputs; how the statement is executed is left to the optimizer

- SQL is a language that works with many types of databases. Nearly identical syntax but some small differences on the margins

## How to interact with SQL: IDEs


```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://blog.coupler.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-bigquery-sql.png")
```

## How to interact with SQL: Python/R

1. Use an R or Python package that helps you connect with a specific
type of database (sqlite3 library in Python)

2. Establish a connection between your local computer and the database

3. Write a SQL query

4. Execute the query

5. Pull the result and work with the result in that language


## SQL Query: Example

<br>

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

select 
	country, 
	ccode, 
	year, 
	riots
from conflict

```

## SQL Query: Main Components

- [SELECT]{.red} columns
- [FROM]{.red} a table in a database
- [WHERE]{.red} rows meet a condition
- [GROUP BY]{.red} values of a column
- [ORDER BY]{.red} values of a column when displaying results
- [LIMIT]{.red} to only X number of rows in resulting table

- [Always required]{.blue}: SELECT and FROM. Rest are optional.

## Aggregate Functions

SELECT can be combined with functions such as SUM, COUNT, AVG... including when using GROUP BY

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
select 
	country,  
	year, 
	sum(riots) as riots,
	sum(protests) as protests
from conflict 
group by country, year
```

## Joins

Relational databases are all about joins. SQL offers the same type of joins as we saw in pandas

- inner join (default)

- left join

- outer join

- Use join + on to define which column to join.
