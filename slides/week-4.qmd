## Class Part II: Control Statements, Loops and Functions

We will go over some concepts that are very general over any programming language.

::: incremental
-   Using logical operators for comparisons.

-   Control the behavior of code when iterating using control statements.

-   Explore iterating through containers using loops

-   Defining functions to make code more flexible, debuggable, and readable. (Probably for next week)
:::

## Comparison Operators

| Operator     | Property                |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| **`==`**     | (value) equivalence     |
| **`>`**      | greater than            |
| **`<`**      | strictly less than      |
| **`<=`**     | less than or equal      |
| **`>`**      | strictly greater than   |
| **`>=`**     | greater than or equal   |
| **`!=`**     | Not Equals              |
| **`is`**     | object identity         |
| **`is not`** | negated object identity |
| **`in`**     | membership in           |
| **`not in`** | negated membership in   |

## Control Statements

Any programming language needs statements that controls the sequence of execution of a particular piece of code.

-   if-else statements
-   for loops
-   while loops

## Ifelse Statements

**Definition:** Conditional execution.

```         

if <logical statement>:
 
 
  ~~~~ CODE ~~~~


elif <logical statement>:


  ~~~~ CODE ~~~~


else:

  ~~~~ CODE ~~~~

```

## For loops

**Definition:** Taking one item at a time from a collection. We start at the beginning of the collection and mover through it until we reach the end.

In python, we can iterate over:

-   lists

-   strings

-   dictionaries

-   file connections

-   grouped pandas df

## Example:

```{python}
# create a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# iterate with a for loop:
for m in my_list:
  print(m)


```

## While Loops

-   While loops are all about repetitions. Instead of a sequence, the operation will repeat up according to the conditional statement in the loop.

```{python}
# while loops
x = 0
while x < 5:
    print("This")
    x += 1
```

# User Defined Functions {background-color="#447099"}


## How do we start coding? 


:::{.incremental}


- write code sequentially to solve your immediate needs

- reuse this code for similar tasks.

- Have very long and repetitive codes

:::


## Problems with this approach

:::{.incremental}

-   Lack of general utility.
-   Need to edit/copy/paste your code every time you want to **reuse it.**
-   Need to re-write the code when you need to make small extenstion
-   Likely to raise errors

:::


## Functions

<br>

```{python}
#| eval: false
def square(x):
  '''
  Takes the square of a number
  input: int object
  outpur: int object
  '''
  y = x*x
  return y
```

<br>

The code block above has the following elements:

- [def](): keyword for generating a function

- [docstring](): to explain your function

- [arguments](): things we want to feed into the function and do something to.

- [return](): keyword for returning a specific value from a function

## Comparing Python and R

```{python}
#| eval: false
def square(x):
  '''
  Takes the square of a number
  input: int object
  outpur: int object
  '''
  y = x*x
  return y
```

<br>

```{r}

square <- function(x){
#  Takes the square of a number
#  input: int object
#  outpur: int object
y = x*x
return(y)
}
```

- In Python, you don't need to assign a object to a function

- The identation blocks your statement. It replaces the curly braces

## Intro to Python- Part II.

For the second part of this lecture, we will see: 

- Importing modules in Python

- Comprehension and Generators

- File management in Python

- Numpy

Notice, we have lecture notes for each of these topics!

## Importing modules in Python

The beauty of open-sourced programming languages is being able build on the shoulders of other colleagues. 

We do this pretty much by importing libraries other programmers developed and made available.

To import a module in Python, you need to explicitly tell python to do it. This works like the **library** function in R. 

Python allows you to import: 

- The full module with the original name

- The full module with a different name

- Some functions from the module

- All methods from the module as independent functions


## The full module and its functions

<br>
```{python}
# import module
import math

# access methods from the module
math.pi
```
<br>
```{python}
# this will throw you an error
pi
```


## The full module and its functions with another name

<br>
```{python}
# import module
import math as m

# access methods from the module
m.pi
m.factorial(5)

```

## Some functions from the module

<br>
```{python}
# import some functions
from math import pi

# run
pi
```

## All methods from the module as independent functions

```{python}
# all methods as independent functions
from math import *

# run
factorial(5)
```

## Comprehensions

- Provide a readable and effective way of performing a particular expression on a iterable series of items.

![](https://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/listComprehensions.gif)


### With a loop

```{python}
a_list =[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, "hey"]
result = []
for e in a_list:
    if type(e) == int:  # use int for Python 3
        result.append(e**2)
result
```

## Why it matters?

- Elegant and cleaner way to perform iterations

- Flexible: allows working with lists, dictionaries, and sets

- Faster than loops. 

# [Notebook for Comprehensions](/lecture_notes/week-04/_week_4_comprehension_generators.html)


## Generators

Python has this very nice data type called **generators**. We use these functions a lot, but hardly talk about them.

:::{.incremental}

- **Purpose:** Generators allow for generating a sequence of values over time

- **Main Advantage:** do not have to create the entire sequence at once and allocate memory

- **Lazy Evaluation:** Returns a value at time. When requested. It is LAZY!!! We love LAZY!

:::

## Example of Generators

You can build your own generators. That's a bit advanced, and you probably will not need to use. 

But we will see some pre-built "generators":

:::{.incremental}

- `range()`: generate the corresponding sequence of integers. Commonly used with for loops. 

- `zip()`: syncs two series of numbers up into tuples.

- `enumerate()`: generates an index and value tuple pairing

## File Management in Python

<br>

### Main question: how do we read files from our computer in python?

- connection management: open(), close()
- Reading/writing files
- using with to manage connections.
- Reading .csvs

## TLDR:

- Most often we will use high-level functions from Pandas to load data into Python objects.

- Why are we learning these tools then?

  - Very pythonic
  
  - No direct equivalent in R or Stata
  
  - Important when working non-tabular data - text, json, images, etc..

- **Reading:** Check Section 3.3 of [Python for Data Analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book/python-builtin.html) to learn more about the topics covered in the notebook. 

## Summary

- **open()**: opens a **connection** with files on our system.
    - **open()** returns a special item type *_io.TextIOWrapper*
    - This item is a iterator. We need to go through to convert inputs to a objectin python. 
    
- **close()**: closes the connection. 

- **write()**: writes files on your system. Also line by line. 

- **with()**: wrapper for open and close that allows alias. 

# [Notebook for File Management](/lecture_notes/week-04/_week_4_file_management.html)


## Motivating Numpy

So far, all our datatypes are geared towards unidimensional data. We can get over with this using a nested list:

```{python}
# Read in the gapminder data 
import csv
with open("../lecture_notes/week-04/gapminder.csv",mode="rt") as file:
    data = [row for row in csv.reader(file)]


```


## Nested Lists

<br>

```{python}
# let's see the data

data[:10]

```

<br>

**This is a weird data structure. Why??**

## Here comes numpy ...

## Why should you learn? Holds Python together!

## Efficiency


- Numpy leans toward less flexibility and more efficiency.

- Lists gives you more flexibility and less efficiency.

- Allows for easy vectorization of functions

- Broadcasting for working with arrays with different dimensions
