    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "- connection management: `open()`, `close()`\n",
    "- Reading/writing files \n",
    "- using `with` to manage connections. \n",
    "- Reading `.csvs`\n",
    "\n",
    "**TLDR:** Most often we will use high-level functions from Pandas to load data into Python objects. However, if you are migrating from `R` or `Stata` to Python, the use of connection management functions (`open()`, `close()` and `with()`) are very characteristic of writing code in Python, and are not heavily used in other languages. These file handlers are also important when working non-tabular data, in which most often you don't need to (or don't want to) fit into a dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\"> \n",
    "\n",
    "**Working Directory:** Notice that we will read some local files in this notebook. These files need to be in the same working directory as your notebook, or else Python will not know where the files are on your computer. Please download the accompanying files (`news-story.txt` and `student_data.csv`) from the class website, and place into a place you can easily set you python towards. Ideally, on the folder you have for this class!\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reading:** Check Section 3.3 of [Python for Data Analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book/python-builtin.html) to learn more about the topics covered in the notebook. "
