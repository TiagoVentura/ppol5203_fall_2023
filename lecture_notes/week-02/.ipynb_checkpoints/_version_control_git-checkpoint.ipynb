    "- Reproducibility in Data Science\n",

    "    +  When projects scale-up,  **you need to keep track of your work**. Sometimes you decide to experiment with a different model, share you code with a colleagues who suggested you to try a different approach, work with some different visualization. All of this, ideally, without altering the previous draft of your results. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Science is a collaborative field\n",
    "\n",
    "    + Data Science is a new and very collaborative field, both in academia and industry. Most of your projects will be shared with other data scientists, and you will want to be able to work at the same time in the project, pushing your ideas in different directions, without affecting what you have already consolidated. \n",
    "    \n",
    "- You will be constantly checking you code and others' code. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Projects will come and go.\n",
    "\n",
    "    + Sometimes a project will slow down, and you will return to it a few months later. Trust me, you will thank you past self if you code is well documented, transparent, and your steps are fully reproducible. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These challenges will appear across different projects, but, most importantly, you are very likely to repeat these tasks for the different iterations of the same project.  As you do this, you need to make sure your results are [reproducible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility#:~:text=For%20the%20findings%20of%20a,when%20the%20study%20is%20replicated.). \n",

As you publish a article/data report/data analysis you need to make sure others (or even you in the future) would be able to easily keep a record of your actions as in the data (cleaning, measurement choices, models), the presentation of the results, all in a reproducible way. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some suggestions for you to overcome these challenges will minimal headaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Documentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `#` to describe every single step of your code\n",
    "\n",
    "**Readability**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make you code readable in plain english. This usually mean giving names to your variables and functions that fully describe what your intents are. \n",
    "- Avoid: \n",
    "    + Abbreviation\n",
    "    + Generice Names\n",
    "    + Misleading names\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Naming**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use meaningful names for your code/data/notebooks. \n",
    "    + File names should be meaningful\n",
    "    + DO NOT USE SPACES. Use [snake case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) `(_)` style for you files and code\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Portability**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use computational environments for your projects. ([pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation)\n",
    "- Avoid specific file paths\n",
    "- Keep track of the version of your package/libraries versions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Self-Contained Projects**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Organize each data analysis into a specific folder on your computer. \n",
    "- In my case, every project folder has the following subfolders: \n",
    "    + /code\n",
    "    + /data\n",
    "    + /outputs\n",
    "    + /literature\n",
    "    + /text\n",
    "    + /misc\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Version Control** \n",
    "\n",
    "- A system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It keeps a complete record of changes to a single file, a folder of material, or a whole project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easily handle collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "- Avoids version file names\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allows you to “rewind the tape” to earlier incarnations of your notes, drafts, papers and code\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is like Microsoft Word track changes but for your entire project\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control is the most complex and most important of the best practices described here for reproducibility in data science. It requires us to learn a tool to perform version control. We will use `Git` to do so. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Git` is one of many option for version control, but it has become the standard for version control in data science. `Git` is a local tool, that you install in your machine. `GitHub` is a public remote host for Git repositories  is a place where software developers and social scientists make their work available, and where you can contribute to ongoing projects or make public your own."
