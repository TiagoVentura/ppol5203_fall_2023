    "## Notion of Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an [object-oriented programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) (OOP) where the object plays a more fundamental role for how we structure a program. Specifically, OOP allows one to bundle properties and behavior into individual objects. In Python, objects can hold both the data and the methods used to manipulate that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you are progressing in the DSPP, you are also being introduced to R. R, on the other hand, is a functional programming language where functions are objects and data is manipulated using functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, the distinction is subtle, but the way we build programs in R and Python differs considerably. In practice, the OOP vs. Functional distinction changes how one engages with objects instantiated in the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, methods (functions) are self-contained in the object; whereas in R functions are external to the object. In other words, while much of the work in R consists on writing functions that are stores outside of classes/objects, in Python, you can borrow from general classes, inherit their methods/functions, or just add new functionalities to objects created by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The core of OOP Languages are the objects. They are also important in R, but not as flexible as in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, see the differences between taking the mean of a vector in R (using a function) and the mean of a pandas series in Python (using a method). "
