    "\n",
    "The famous acronym API stands for “Application Programming Interface”. An API is an online server allows different applications to interact. Most often for our purposes, an API will facilitate information exchange between data users and the holders of certain data. Many companies build these repositories for various functions, including sharing data, receiving data, joint database management, and providing artificial intelligence functions or machines for public use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think of an example capable of motivating the creation of an API. Imagine you own Twitter. You would have zillions of hackers every day trying to scrape your data, this would make your website more unstable and insecure. What is a possible solution? You create an API, and you control who accesses the information, when they access it, and what type of information you make available. Another option is to close you API and restrict data access to researchers. But, if you do this, you are likely to pay a reputational cost for not being transparent, and users might leave your platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever watched Matrix? APIs are just like that! In the movies, Neil and others would physically connect their mindes to a super developed server  and ask to learn a certain skill - kung-fu, programming, language, etc. This is exactly what an API does. You connect to the website and request data, and receive it in return. It's like sending an email, but doing everything via programming language."

    "- `/businesses/search` - Search for businesses by keyword, category, location, price level, etc.\n",
    "- `/businesses/{id}` - Get rich business data, such as name, address, phone number, photos, Yelp rating, price levels and hours of operation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Most often, the provider of an API will require you to authenticate before you can get some data. Authentication usually occures through an access token you can generate directly from the API.  Depending on the type of authentication each API have in place, it can be a simple token (string) or multiple different ids (Client ID, Access Token, Client Token..)\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that using a token is better than using a username and password for a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Typically, you'll be accessing an API from a script. If you put your username and password in the script and someone finds it, they can take over your account. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Access tokens can have scopes and specific permissions. \n",
    "\n",
    "To authorize your access, you need to add the token to your API call. Often, you do this by passing the token through an authorization header. We can use Python's requests library to make a dictionary of headers, and then pass it into our request.\n"
